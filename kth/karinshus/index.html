			<h1>The House of Karin</h1>

			<p>On the ground floor you find a good kitchen with a table big enough for at least eight persons. There's a big bright living room with a fireplace for rainy days and a rocking chair, in case you need a to do a lullaby. Two smaller bedrooms, toilet with a shower and a room for laundry. Upstairs you have two bigger rooms and a toilet with shower.</p>

			<p>There are six beds with the possibility to arrange two extra beds. Also a bed for the baby and protection for the stairs, if needed. It has a normal standard with a refrigerator/freezer and a washing machine, an old TV with a video if the weather should turn out bad for a longer period of time and a grill on the terrace.</p>

			<p>The house is close to the lake, a distance of 150 meters. You can borrow a boat and go fishing or swimming from one of the small islands. The boat is stored only a kilometer from the house. There are also some bikes you can loan.</p>
